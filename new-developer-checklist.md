## Gmail

If you don't already have one, create a Gmail (Google) Account

> https://accounts.google.com/signup

### Why?

Your email address says a lot about you.

or http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10605176/What-does-your-email-address-say-about-you.html

Gmail is the best ("free") email service (we are aware of).
They take security seriously and have *many* great features
(like search, filters and threaded messages).

### Tip for Choosing a Gmail Address
Hundreds of millions of people have gmail accounts
(most simply to use the Google/Android Play Store)
as a result it can be hard to get your name as your gmail address.
e.g. Andrew.Smith@gmail.com is taken. So, consider adding an initial

Make sure you use a ***strong*** password. If someone can guess (or "crack")
your password they will gain access to *everything* else. not good... :hankey:


## Twitter

~~While~~ having a twitter account is ~~not~~ essential, it helps you
to stay up to date with news/updates in your chosen field. https://twitter.com/

Even if you don't become a Twitter "Power User", its good to follow
what's going on in your the world of web/app development.

### Chosing a good Twitter "Handle"

> "All of the *good* names are taken..."

Not true.

Sure, *many* short, single word or personal names are taken,
but there are still *plenty* of two-word or "_invented_" names
you can pick from. *Get creative* with keeping your handle as short as possible.
while making it easy to remember/type.

### Follow

Decide what you want to be good at (_known for_) and _follow_ all
the people who are already doing (_good_) work in that area.

Follow people you know in "real world" so you can keep in touch.

### Favourite :heart:

*Favourite* the tweets you find useful/interesting/insightful/informative,
this serves multiple purposes:  
(a) bookmark content so you can return to it later.  
(b) the author of the tweet/content knows it was useful so they will make more!
(c) your followers can see what you find like-worthy.

### Re-Tweet :recycle:

If you think a post someone has shared is good re-tweet it!
This has *many* positive effects:  
(a) the person who posted the content will
get *positive reenforcement* (*i.e. they will make more content*),
(b) the content author might follow you back (*if they don't already*)  
(c) if you consistently re-tweet useful content you will become known
for relevance in that area and more people will follow/re-tweet you!

Github.com is where people share the code they are working on,
