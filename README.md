A Quick-start Guide for people that want to build ***apps we all love*** using!

## Why?

> If you haven't read **Simon Sinek**'s book "***Start with Why***",
we *highly recommend* taking a few minutes to watch his **Ted Talk**:
http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action


The world is not perfect.  
We have all worked somewhere we *didn't* ***love***. <br />
We have *all* felt the *frustration* of using products that had/have flaws
(*and been unable to fix them*) <br/>
The aim of dwyl is to address *both* of these "*bugs*" *symultaneously*.

If you'd like to know more, *please read* ***our [manifesto](/manifesto.md)***.

*If* you want to be part of the solution, join us: http://www.dwyl.io/

## Who?

**dwyl** is a ***rapidly expanding community*** ... here are a few
of the familiar faces contributing to the projects:

[![dwyl-people](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/9920000/97649832-5cc8-11e5-972e-bb06f2abc237.png)](https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/people)

***Join us*** in finding something you want to ***solve*** and will
***love*** working on.


## What?

**Q**: What is dwyl?  
**A**: dwyl (*pronounced like the name "[Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxnonO3FXw)"
but with a "D" at the start*) is a *community* of people on a
***mission to change the world using code***.

We are *making* the tools *we* need to help us
(and the people we care about) get things (*they love*) ***done***.

Our first App is [***Time***](https://github.com/dwyl/time) which helps people ***track any time based activity***.

And we are making ***Everything Open Source*** along the way,
so that you *too* can **D**o **W**hat **Y**ou **L**ove!

We have plans to build *many* other features and we'd *love* you to join us!

+ [Tudo](https://github.com/dwyl/tudo) (*pronounced todo*) helps you and your team track what you are working on.
+ When? [sync calendars and selectively share availability with your work colleagues, friends & family to discover when the best time for an activity/event is]
- Birthday/Special Event Reminder [*AKA* The Card & Gift App]
- *What question do* ***you*** *want to answer...*?


### Scratching Your *Own* Itch

We believe in scratching our own itch.
Scratching your own itch means solving a problem you (or someone *close* to you) *personally* have.
If you (or someone close to you) don't have any personal experience in a field
you aren't going to do a good job of spotting/solving a problem in that area.

Taking the "*Business School*" approach of finding a "*Big Market*" and then identifying a problem to solve works for *some* companies,
but we prefer the approach of solving something we are *personally passionate* about regardless of the (*size of the*) "*market*".

## Web Development *Fun*damentals

We have listed the skills you need to know in the *order* you need to learn them.
Here is a checklist: https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/new-developer-checklist.md

### Basic Computer Skills

![have_you_tried_turning_it_off_and_on_again_tshirt-r15b877ba3b4142bba14c938377e7fed7_v9uic_1024](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/8126653/74557e82-10e8-11e5-8e5d-4fe33d734d8f.jpg)

If you don't feel *confident* using a computer, don't despair!
We've all been there. There's no "*secret*" to becoming an expert, just *experiment*! If you get *stuck*, ***Google***, if you're still stuck after an hour, ***ask for help***! If all else fails, *restart* your PC and try again! (*that's what* ***everyone does***)



### Touch Typing

***Before*** you dive into programming, learning how to touch-type on your
computer is the *single* ***best investment*** you can make.
All this means is *practising* typing with the "*correct* fingers" until you don't have to think about where the keys are. Some of the best programmers we know can type faster than *most* people can *think* ... take a moment for that to settle in.

[![playing piano blindfolded](http://i.imgur.com/4dzAeSz.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iyiWHI2nA "playing piano blindfolded")

You need to be able to *type* ***blindfolded*** to become a true maestro (*at anything computer-related*).
