## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

The world is not perfect. <br />
We have all worked somewhere we *didn't* ***love***. <br />
We have all experienced using products that had/have flaws. <br/>
Rather than *waiting* for someone else to solve our "problems"
we are taking on the challenge ourselves.
And we are making ***Everything Open Source*** along the way,
so that you too can **D**o **W**hat **Y**ou **L**ove!

**We simplify. We enable people to get through their _need-tos_ efficiently so they can get to their _want-tos_.**

If you'd like to know more, *please read* ***our [manifesto](/manifesto.md)***.

And if you haven't read Simon Sinek's book,
we *highly recommend* you watch his Ted Talk on ***Start with Why***:

## Who?

***Everyone*** should be doing on something they *love*.

For now the people working on dwyl are just four people:
[@iteles](https://twitter.com/iteles), [@nelsonic](https://twitter.com/nelsonic),
[@edwardcodes](https://github.com/edwardcodes)
and
[@hyprstack](https://github.com/hyprstack)

***Join us*** in finding something you want to ***solve*** and will
***love*** working on.


## What?

We are building the tools we need to help us (and the people we care about) get things (*they love*) ***done***.

- Time [track any time based activity]
+ Doing [track what you are working on ...]
- Next [record, prioritise, share & collaborate on your ideas]
- When? [sync calendars and selectively share availability with your work colleagues, friends & family to discover when the best time for an activity/event is]
- Birthday/Special Event Reminder [*AKA* The Card & Gift App]
- *What question do* ***you*** *want to answer...*?


### Scratching Your *Own* Itch

We believe in scratching our own itches.
Scratching your own itch means solving a problem you (or someone *close* to you) *personally* have.
If you (or someone close to you) don't have any personal experience in a field
you aren't going to do a good job of spotting/solving a problem in that area.

## What do I need?

- [x] ***Curiosity*** - "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." ~ Albert Einstein
- [x] ***Enthusiasm*** - "Enthusiasm spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment." ~ Norman Vincent Peale
- [x] [***Shoshin***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) (**Beginner's Mind**)
  + "*I'm not young enough to know everything*" ~ [J. M. Barrie](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie)
  + “*Your mind is like a parachute; it only works when it is open*.”  ~ Anthony D'Angelo
- [x] ***Persistance*** - “If you wish to be out front, then act as if you were behind.” ~ Lao Tzu
- [ ] Time (work [**super hard** ... ***every waking hour***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU7W7qe2R0A))
- [x] **Awareness** of how you're spending your time and learning to work to your productive hours and habits
+ [ ] ***Great Google Skills*** - the ability to formulate a good question (*so you can get a useful answer from Google*) is (*more than*) half the challenge in any coding task.
- [ ] ***Self-reliance***: when you get stuck on a task, knowing when to ***ask for help*** and when to persevere through to find the answer yourself.

### What *tools* will I need?

- [x] ***A computer*** (preferably a *recent* one ... *Chromebooks are Great!*)

#### Software

*Installing* software is 100% optional. You can use Cloud9 to develop completely online: https://c9.io/

If you prefer to develop offline or have a faster response, you will need:

- [x] A text editor. e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [x] [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) for building server-side apps.


## Web Development _Fun_damentals

We have listed the skills you need to know in the order you need to learn them.
Here is a checklist: https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/new-developer-checklist.md

### Basic Computer Skills

![have_you_tried_turning_it_off_and_on_again_tshirt-r15b877ba3b4142bba14c938377e7fed7_v9uic_1024](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/8126653/74557e82-10e8-11e5-8e5d-4fe33d734d8f.jpg)

If you don't feel *confident* using a computer, don't despair!
We've all been there. There's no "*secret*" to becoming an expert, just *experiment*! If you get *stuck*, ***Google***, if you're still stuck after an hour, ***ask for help***! If all else fails, *restart* your PC and try again! (*that's what* ***everyone does***)



### Touch Typing

***Before*** you dive into programming, learning how to touch-type on your
computer is the *single* ***best investment*** you can make.
All this means is *practising* typing with the "*correct* fingers" until you don't have to think about where the keys are. Some of the best programmers we know can type faster than *most* people can *think* ... take a moment for that to settle in.

[![playing piano blindfolded](http://i.imgur.com/4dzAeSz.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iyiWHI2nA "playing piano blindfolded")

You need to be able to *type* ***blindfolded*** to become a true maestro (*at anything computer-related*).

### JavaScript

Love it or hate it, **JavaScript is** ***Ubiquitous***. Becoming a ***JS Ninja*** is ***essential***.
[Ines](http://github.com/iteles) has prepared some great notes on
[JavaScript The Good Parts](https://github.com/iteles/Javascript-the-Good-Parts/blob/master/Notes-on-Javascript-the-Good-Parts.md)
Keep "**The Good Parts**" in mind while you are *writing* (*and reading*) JS.

Watch this 1 hour intro tutorial:

we suggest you checkout [@NataliaLKB](https://github.com/NataliaLKB)'s Tutorial: https://github.com/NataliaLKB/learn-git-basics

### Testing

Testing is often left as an afterthought or ommitted completely from
"beginner" tutorials or books. That will not be the case here.
You will learn *why* testing is not just a "nice-to-have".

### Service Oriented Architecture with (REST) APIs

We will be building our apps with RESTful
[Service Oriented Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)
Backend. This has *several* advantages:

1. Each piece of functionality is run as a service (so its easy to isolate, test and scale)
2. The client we build (web app or mobile app) both (independently) "consume" the same service via REST API
(which means that the font-end is completely decoupled from the backend of the app - easier to change/itterate)
3. If our app/product gets popular we already have an API built and can allow 3rd party integration/extensions.


I'm busy preparing a *detailed* tutorial for doing exactly this using Hapi.js
at: https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi
You can already get started reading it and the supporting links
And watch as the tutorial progresses.

### Which Client MVC Framework?

- ~~Angular.js - Mature and full-featured~~
- ~~Backbone.js - Well-structured and minimalist~~
- Riot.js - Minimalist and Reactive (learn it in 2h)

We are using Riot.js because its ***Tiny***
and compares favorably to Polymer and React:
https://muut.com/riotjs/compare.html

Also it does ***server-side rendering*** out-of-the-box:
https://muut.com/riotjs/guide/#server-side which we need
for *progressive enhancement*.

Ultimately we want to wrap our JS as PhoneGap app (see mobile below)
so that the app can be run as a semi-native app (download from app store,
local/offline storage, etc.) and it makes sense to keep it as small as possible.



### Which Database?

In the past we have used:

- Postgres - The best relational dabase for
- MongoDB  - Good balance of features, performance and ease of use.
- CouchDB  - Great reliability, master-master replication and simplicity.
+ RethinkDB - we *love* RethinkDB, but sadly there's no "free tier" on heroku...

But for this project we are going to be using:

+ ***Redis*** for its speed, flexibility and pub-sub
+ ***ElasticSearch*** for full-text near-real-time search.

If you are new to either of these please checkout our tutorials:

+ Redis: https://github.com/docdis/learn-redis
+ ElasticSearch: https://github.com/docdis/learn-elasticsearch


## Mobile

### Phonegap

We are using PhoneGap to *rapidly prototype* "hybrid" mobile applications.

- PhoneGap Tutorial: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/02/11/four-ways-to-build-a-mobile-app-part3-phonegap/

#### What is the Difference between Native and Hybrid Apps?

- Jacob Nielson explains Native vs Hybrid:
http://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-native-apps
- Is Hybrid ready? http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/20/html5-vs-native-vs-hybrid-mobile-apps-3500-developers-say-all-three-please/ (the short answer is ***Yes***!)

A good (but *long*) intro tutorial to PhoneGap V.3 was recorded
[@LXJS](http://2013.lxjs.org/guide) in October 2013:
http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/11/12/lxjs-workshop/
