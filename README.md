Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. ~ Arthur Ashe
==========

A Quick-start Guide for People who want to build awesome apps.

## Why?

The world is not perfect.
We have all worked somewhere we *didn't* ***love***. <br />
We have all experienced using products that had flaws.

Rather than waiting for someone else to solve our "problems" we are taking on the challenge ourselves.


## Who?

Who is "We"?

For now we are just three people: 
[@iteles](https://twitter.com/iteles),  [@mmendes](https://github.com/mmendes999)
and 
[@nelsonic](https://twitter.com/nelsonic)


We hope that you join us in finding something you ***love*** working on.


## What?

We are building the web/mobile applications that we wish existed.

- Card App [working title]
- ideaQ
- *Your Idea Here*?


### Scratching Your Own Itch


Scratching your own itch means solving a problem you (or someone *close* to you) *personally* have.

## Web

### JavaScript

[Ines](http://github.com/iteles) has prepared a great notes on
[JavaScript The Good Parts](https://github.com/iteles/Javascript-the-Good-Parts/blob/master/Notes-on-Javascript-the-Good-Parts.md)


### Which Client MVC Framework?

- Angular.js
- Backbone.js
- Riot.js

Right now I'm toying with the idea of using either Angular or Riot.

Ultimately we want to wrap our JS as PhoneGap app (see mobile below)
so that the app can be run as a semi-native app (download from app store,
local/offline storage, etc.) and it makes sense to keep it as small as possible.



### Which Datbase?

- Postgres
- MongoDB
- CouchDB

Having recently used MongoDB for a client project I'm swaying towards using it
for my next app. But I'm a huge fan of CouchDB.
I will need to spend a bit of time investigating a few features tomorrow...



## Mobile

### Phonegap

We are using PhoneGap to *rapidly prototype* "hybrid" mobile applications.

#### What is the Difference between Native and Hybrid Apps?

- Jacob Nielson explains Native vs Hybrid: 
http://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-native-apps
- Is Hybrid ready? http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/20/html5-vs-native-vs-hybrid-mobile-apps-3500-developers-say-all-three-please/ (the short answer is ***Yes***!)

A good (but *long*) intro tutorial to PhoneGap V.3 was recorded 
[@LXJS](http://2013.lxjs.org/guide) in October 2013:
