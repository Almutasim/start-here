A Quick-start Guide for people that want to **D**o **W**hat **Y**ou **L**ove!

## Why?
The world is not perfect.
We have all worked somewhere we _didn't **love**_. <br />
We have _all_ felt the _frustration_ of using products that have flaws
(and been unable to fix them).
**The aim of _dwyl_ is to address *both* of these issues _simultaneously_.**

If you'd like to know more, _please **read our [manifesto](/manifesto.md)**_.
 The short version is:
"_**Treat others as you would like others to treat you**_" ~
[**The Golden Rule**](/manifesto.md)

If you want to be part of the solution, join us: http://www.dwyl.io/

> If you haven't read **Simon Sinek**'s book "***Start with Why***",
we *highly recommend* taking a few minutes to watch his **Ted Talk**:

## Who?

**dwyl** is a _**rapidly expanding community**_; here are a few
of the familiar faces contributing to our projects:

[![dwyl-people](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/9920000/97649832-5cc8-11e5-972e-bb06f2abc237.png)](https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/people)

[_**Join us**_](#how) in finding a problem you want to **solve** and will
_**love**_ working on.


## What?

**Q**: What is dwyl?
**A**: dwyl (pronounced "[Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxnonO3FXw)"
but with a "D" infront of it) is a _community_ of people on a
_**mission to change the world using technology**_.

We are _starting_ by making the tools _we_ need to help us (and the people we care about) _get things we love **done**_.

Our first App is [***Time***](https://github.com/dwyl/time) which helps people ***track any time based activity***.

And we are making ***Everything Open Source*** along the way,
so that you *too* can **D**o **W**hat **Y**ou **L**ove!
We have plans to build *many* other features and we'd *love* you to join us!

Here are a few on the roadmap:
+ [**Tudo**](https://github.com/dwyl/tudo) (_pronounced to-do_) helps you and your team track what you are working on
+ **When?** syncs calendars and selectively share availability with others to discover when the best time for an activity/event is
- Birthday/Special Event Helper [*AKA* The Card & Gift App]

What question do _**you**_ want to answer?


### Our Approach: Scratching Your *Own* Itch

We believe in scratching our own itch.
This means solving a problem you (or someone _close_ to you) _personally_ have.
If you don't have any personal experience in a field
you aren't going to do a good job of spotting/solving a problem in that area.

Taking the _"Business School"_ approach of finding a _"Big Market"_ and then identifying a problem to solve works for some companies,
but we prefer the approach of solving something we are **personally passionate about** _regardless_ of the (size of the) "market".

# How?

If you want to get involved with building great tools people love, this section contains everything you need to know.


## What do I need?

+ [ ] **Curiosity** - "I have **no special talent**. I am only _**passionately curious**_." - Albert Einstein
+ [ ] **Enthusiasm** - "Enthusiasm spells the _**difference between mediocrity and accomplishment**_." - Norman Vincent Peale
+ [ ] [**Shoshin**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) (**Beginner's Mind**) - "I'm not young enough to know everything" - J. M. Barrie
+ [ ] **Persistance** - "If you wish to be out front, then act as if you were behind.” - Lao Tzu
+ [ ] **Work Ethic** - ["**work super hard** ... _**every waking hour**_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU7W7qe2R0A) ~ Elon Musk
+ [ ] **Time** - if you only have _**1 minute**_ there's _something_ you can do _now_!
+ [ ] **Great Google Skills** - the ability to formulate a good question (so you can get a useful answer from Google) is (more than) half the challenge in any ~~coding~~ task
+ [ ] **Self-reliance**: when you get stuck on a task, knowing **when to ask for help** and when to _persevere_ through to find the answer yourself
  + But don't worry, we're here to help! [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/dwyl/chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/dwyl/chat/)

### What *tools* will I need?

**Access to a computer**, preferably a recent (but not expensive) one (Chromebooks are Great!).
That's it.

### Do I need to Write *Code* to Contribute?

No. _Everyone_ can contribute, from proposing and voting on ideas,
to simplifying wording to helping people understand our apps.

Please drop by and tell us what you think! [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/dwyl/chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/dwyl/chat/)


### Setup (_for Coders_)

If you want to start writing `code` _now_ and don't already have your machine set up, see: https://github.com/dwyl/setup

We also have a **new developer checklist** which  we _encourage_ you to review:
https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/new-developer-checklist.md


## Web Development *Fun*damentals

We have listed the skills you need to know in the _order_ you need to learn them.

### Basic Computer Skills

![have_you_tried_turning_it_off_and_on_again_tshirt-r15b877ba3b4142bba14c938377e7fed7_v9uic_1024](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/8126653/74557e82-10e8-11e5-8e5d-4fe33d734d8f.jpg)

If you don't feel _confident_ using a computer, don't despair!
We've all been there.
There's no "secret" to becoming an expert, just _experiment_! If you get stuck, _**Google**_.
If you're still stuck after an hour, **ask for help**!
If all else fails, *restart* your computer and try again (that's what _**everyone**_ **does**).


### Touch Typing

_**Before**_ you dive into programming, learning how to touch-type on your
computer is the *single* _**best investment**_ you can make.
All this means is _practising_ typing with the "correct fingers" until you don't have to think about where the keys are.
Some of the best programmers we know can type faster than most people can _think_ ... take a moment for that to settle in.

[![playing piano blindfolded](http://i.imgur.com/4dzAeSz.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iyiWHI2nA "playing piano blindfolded")

You need to be able to **type blindfolded** to become a true maestro (at anything computer-related).

A few touch-typing tutorials anyone can (_should_) do a few minutes per day:
