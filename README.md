A Quick-start Guide for New People.

## Why?

We have all worked somewhere we *didn't* ***love***. <br />
We have all experienced using products that had flaws.

Rather than waiting for someone else to solve our "problems" do it ourselves.




## Who?

Who is "We"?

For now we are just two people: 
[@iteles](https://twitter.com/iteles) and 
[@nelsonic](https://twitter.com/nelsonic)

We hope that you join us in finding something you ***love*** working on.


## What?

We are building the web/mobile applications that we wish existed.

- Card App
- ideaQ

### Phonegap

We are using PhoneGap to *rapidly prototype* "hybrid" mobile applications.

A good (but *long*) intro tutorial to PhoneGap V.3 was recorded
