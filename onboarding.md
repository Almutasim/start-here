# Onboarding

Thoughts on the [***onboarding***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding) process.

The process of [***onboarding***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onboarding)
new people into your organisation in _general_ and `developers` _specifically_
is one we've thought about _extensively_ and is the _purpose_ of the `start-here` repo!

We _openly_ acknowledge that (_besides a readme with links to other readmes_)
we are doing a _woefully poor_ job of getting people "_up-to-speed_" on our org... ðŸ˜¢  
(_even though this is the single **highest value task** we can perform!_)

> It would be _great_ to get other people's thoughts on the process from the
various perspectives you've had working in _several_ different organisations.
have you ever worked somewhere that had a "_bullet-proof_" _step-by-step_
process for new people joining a team/org?

## Why?

Making people _feel_ loved/included and part of the community/team _instantly_
is the goal of the `start-here` repository.

After we have _explained_ what our _purpose_ is and people are _keen_ to
get started. We need to have a clear _process_


## What?

Make people _feel_ welcome, loved and empowered to get started without delay!


## How?

1. Make the person feel welcome. Make them feel like it's their _Birthday_ and everyone is celebrating! :tada:
5. [**Understand**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpNbW9MAarQ) the person on a _personal_ level: what makes them "_tick_"?
Only by understanding a person's _intrinsic motivations_ can you hope to
4. **Contextualize** and give the "Brief History of ..." so they _know_ "where we came from".
1. Introduce the person to all the relevant people in the org/team they are going to need to speak to and why.
2. Give person the **tools** they need to get started without delay. see: https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/131
3. Show the person the knowledge they will need before they can be productive: https://github.com/dwyl?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=learn
6. Ensure the person has a complete knowledge of our Why? What? and How?
6. Help the person pick a task to start with from the backlog.
